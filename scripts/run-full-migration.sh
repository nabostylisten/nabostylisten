# Full Migration Script
# This script resets the database and runs all migration phases in order
#
# MIGRATION SCOPE (Updated):
# Phase 1: Users (buyer + stylist ‚Üí profiles + stylist_details + user_preferences)
# Phase 2: Addresses (MySQL address ‚Üí PostgreSQL addresses with PostGIS)
# Phase 3: Services (category/subcategory ‚Üí service_categories, services with trial session defaults)
# Phase 4: Bookings (MySQL booking ‚Üí bookings with enhanced payment/trial fields)
# Phase 5: Payments (MySQL payment ‚Üí payments with affiliate integration fields)
# Phase 6: Communication (chat + message ‚Üí chats + chat_messages)
# Phase 7: Reviews (rating ‚Üí reviews)
#
# NOT MIGRATED (Clean start or new features):
# - Discount system (old promocode) - Admin will create new discounts
# - Affiliate marketing system - New business model, starts fresh
# - Recurring availability - Stylists will reconfigure in new iCal system
# - Booking notes - New feature, starts post-migration
#
# Logs are written to: scripts/migration/logs/
# - session.log: Complete session log
# - errors.log: Error details
# - warnings.log: Warning messages
# - debug.log: Debug information (when DEBUG=true)
# - progress.log: Progress updates
# - validation-errors.log: Data validation errors

# Don't exit on error - we want to handle migration warnings gracefully
