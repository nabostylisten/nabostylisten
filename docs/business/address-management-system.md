# Address Management System

## Overview

The address management system enables users (both customers and stylists) to store, manage, and use multiple addresses throughout the Nabostylisten platform. This system supports the core business requirement of location-based services, where beauty treatments can be performed either at the customer's location or at the stylist's location.

## Business Purpose

### Core Value Proposition
- **Customer Convenience**: Customers can save multiple addresses (home, work, vacation properties) for easy booking
- **Service Flexibility**: Enables at-home services, a key differentiator for the platform
- **Geographic Discovery**: Helps stylists understand their service coverage areas
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces friction in the booking process by pre-storing address information

### Target Users
- **Customers**: Store delivery/service addresses for bookings
- **Stylists**: Store their business locations and define service coverage areas
- **Platform**: Analyze geographic service coverage and demand

## Key Features

### Address Storage and Management
- **Multiple Addresses**: Users can store unlimited addresses with custom nicknames
- **Primary Address**: One address designated as default for quick selection
- **Address Validation**: Integration with Mapbox for address autocomplete and validation
- **Geographic Coordinates**: Automatic geocoding for location-based services

### Address Types and Use Cases
- **Home Address**: Primary residence for personal services
- **Work Address**: Office location for convenient appointment scheduling
- **Temporary Locations**: Vacation rentals, events, or other one-time service locations
- **Stylist Locations**: Business addresses where stylists provide services

### User Experience Features

## Integration Points

### Booking System Integration
- **Service Location Selection**: Addresses used to determine where service occurs
- **Stylist Matching**: Geographic proximity influences stylist recommendations
- **Travel Calculations**: Distance between addresses affects service availability

### Application Process Integration
- **Stylist Applications**: Address collection during onboarding
- **Verification**: Address validation ensures legitimate business locations
- **Coverage Analysis**: Understanding geographic distribution of stylists

### Payment System Integration
- **Service Fees**: Travel distance may affect pricing
- **Tax Calculations**: Address determines applicable tax jurisdictions

## Business Rules

### Address Validation
- All addresses must be validated through Mapbox geocoding
- Invalid or unrecognizable addresses are rejected
- System stores both human-readable and machine-readable coordinates

### Primary Address Logic
- Each user must have exactly one primary address
- First address is automatically set as primary
- Setting new primary automatically unsets previous one
- Primary address is default selection in booking flows

### Data Privacy and Security
- Addresses are private to the owning user
- Stylists only see customer addresses for confirmed bookings
- Address data includes entry instructions visible to service providers
- Full addresses are never shared in public stylist profiles

### Geographic Constraints
- System currently optimized for Norwegian addresses
- Mapbox integration supports international addresses
- PostGIS geographic functions use WGS84 coordinate system
- Distance calculations use accurate geodesic formulas

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Address Adoption Rate**: Percentage of users with saved addresses
- **Multi-Address Usage**: Users with 2+ addresses indicate engagement
- **Primary Address Changes**: Frequency suggests active management

### Service Quality
- **Address Accuracy**: Reduced delivery/service location errors
- **Booking Completion**: Higher completion rates with pre-saved addresses
