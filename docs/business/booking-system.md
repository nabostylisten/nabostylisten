# Booking System

## Overview

The booking system enables authenticated customers to convert their shopping cart contents into confirmed appointments with stylists. It provides a seamless transition from service selection to actual appointment scheduling, integrating cart data, availability management, and payment processing.

## Business Purpose

- **Appointment Scheduling**: Convert service selections into time-bound appointments
- **Calendar Integration**: Provide real-time availability and booking confirmation
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment collection before appointment confirmation
- **Communication Channel**: Enable customer-stylist communication post-booking
- **Service Delivery**: Ensure smooth execution of booked services

## Core Business Rules

### 1. Authentication Required

**Rule**: All booking functionality requires authenticated users.

**Rationale**:

- Payment processing requires verified identity
- Booking history and management need user accounts

- Cancellation and modification policies need user tracking

**Implementation**:

- Middleware enforces authentication on `/bestilling` route

6. Payment processing and booking confirmation

**Data Transfer**:

### 3. Single Appointment Rule

**Rule**: All cart services must be bookable in a single appointment slot.

**Benefits**:
