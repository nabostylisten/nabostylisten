# Phase 5 Payments Migration Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan provides step-by-step validation procedures for each script in the Phase 5 Payments Migration process. This phase migrates the payment system from MySQL to PostgreSQL, including payment records, Stripe integrations, and financial calculations. Phase 5 requires completed Phase 4 (Bookings) migration.

## Prerequisites

- **Phase 4 Completed**: Bookings migration must be successfully completed (bookings-created.json required)
- **Required Files**:
  - `bookings-created.json` from Phase 4
  - MySQL dump file with payment data
- **Supabase local database**: Running with Phase 1-4 data
- **All dependencies installed**: (`bun install`)

## Environment Variables

Set these before running any scripts:

```bash
export MYSQL_DUMP_PATH="/Users/magnusrodseth/dev/personal/nabostylisten/nabostylisten_prod.sql"
```

---

## Step 1: Extract Payments (`01-extract-payments.ts`)

### Purpose

Extracts payment records from MySQL dump, transforms data for PostgreSQL compatibility, maps payment IDs to booking IDs, handles status transformations, and calculates financial amounts.

### Input Validation

1. **Verify MySQL dump has payment table:**

   ```bash
   grep -c "CREATE TABLE \`payment\`" nabostylisten_prod.sql  # Should return 1
   grep -c "INSERT INTO \`payment\`" nabostylisten_prod.sql  # Should return > 0
   ```

2. **Verify Phase 4 dependencies exist:**

   ```bash
   ls scripts/migration/temp/bookings-created.json  # Should exist
   jq '.metadata.successful_creations' scripts/migration/temp/bookings-created.json  # Should return > 0
   ```

### Expected MySQL Payment Table Structure

**Payment table columns:**

- id (varchar 36)
- payment_intent_id (varchar 255) - Stripe payment intent ID
- stylist_amount (decimal) - Amount to be paid to stylist
- platform_amount (decimal) - Platform fee
- salon_amount (decimal) - Salon commission (removed in new system)
- salon_percentage (decimal) - Salon percentage (removed in new system)
- stylist_transfer_id (varchar 255) - Stripe transfer ID for stylist payout
- salon_transfer_id (varchar 255) - Stripe transfer ID for salon (removed in new system)
- status (varchar) - Payment status
- created_at, updated_at (datetime)

### Expected MySQL Booking Table Structure (for mapping)

**Booking table columns (relevant for payments):**

- id (varchar 36)
- payment_id (varchar 36) - Foreign key to payment.id
- buyer_id, stylist_id (varchar 36)
- status (varchar)
- date_time (datetime)

### Expected Status Mappings

| MySQL Status  | PostgreSQL Status | Additional Processing |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| pending       | pending           | None                  |
| needs_capture | requires_capture  | None                  |
| captured      | succeeded         | Set captured_at       |
| cancelled     | cancelled         | None                  |
| refunded      | succeeded         | Set refunded_amount   |
| failed        | cancelled         | None                  |

```bash
bun run scripts/migration/phase-5-payments/01-extract-payments.ts
```

WHERE b.id IS NULL;  -- Should be 0

-- Verify unique constraint on booking_id
SELECT booking_id, COUNT(*) as payment_count
FROM payments
GROUP BY booking_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;  -- Should return no rows (one payment per booking)

-- Check status distribution
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(AVG(final_amount), 2) as avg_amount,
  ROUND(SUM(platform_fee), 2) as total_platform_fee,

-- Validate financial calculations
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM payments
WHERE final_amount != (stylist_payout + platform_fee);  -- Should be 0

-- Check Stripe integration
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_payments,
  COUNT(payment_intent_id) as with_payment_intent,
  COUNT(stylist_transfer_id) as with_transfers,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN refunded_amount > 0 THEN 1 END) as with_refunds
FROM payments;

-- Verify payment timestamps
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM payments
WHERE
  (status = 'succeeded' AND captured_at IS NULL) OR
  (refunded_amount > 0 AND refund_reason IS NULL);  -- Should be 0

-- Check for negative amounts
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM payments
WHERE
  final_amount < 0 OR
  platform_fee < 0 OR
  stylist_payout < 0 OR
  refunded_amount < 0;  -- Should be 0
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue                   | Solution                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| "Foreign key violation" | Ensure booking exists in database         |
| "Duplicate key error"   | Check for existing payment with same ID   |
| "Unique constraint"     | Booking already has a payment             |
| "Invalid amount"        | Check amount calculations and conversions |
| "Invalid status"        | Verify status mapping from MySQL          |

#### 10. Final Validation Summary

```sql
-- Final comprehensive validation
WITH validation_summary AS (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_payments,
    COUNT(DISTINCT booking_id) as unique_bookings,
    COUNT(payment_intent_id) as with_stripe_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN final_amount != (stylist_payout + platform_fee) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as calculation_errors,
    SUM(CASE WHEN final_amount < 0 OR platform_fee < 0 OR stylist_payout < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as negative_amounts,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status NOT IN ('pending', 'requires_capture', 'succeeded', 'cancelled') THEN 1 END) as invalid_status
  FROM payments
)
SELECT
  'FINAL VALIDATION SUMMARY' as validation_report,
  CASE
    WHEN calculation_errors = 0
     AND negative_amounts = 0
     AND invalid_status = 0
     AND with_stripe_id = total_payments
    THEN 'â MIGRATION SUCCESSFUL - All validations passed'
    ELSE 'â MIGRATION ISSUES DETECTED - Review failed checks above'
  END as overall_status,
  total_payments,
  unique_bookings,
  calculation_errors,
  negative_amounts,
  invalid_status,
  with_stripe_id as payments_with_stripe_id

## Integration Testing

After successful Phase 5 completion:

1. **Test payment display:**

   - Payment history shows correctly for bookings
   - Payment status displays properly
   - Financial amounts are accurate
   - Refund information displays correctly

2. **Test Stripe integration:**

   - Payment intent IDs link correctly
   - Transfer IDs are preserved
   - Application fee amounts are correct
   - Webhook processing works (if applicable)

3. **Test financial reporting:**

   - Revenue calculations are accurate
   - Platform fee reports match expectations
   - Stylist payout calculations are correct
   - Refund tracking works properly

4. **Test payment operations:**
   - Payment capture process (for requires_capture status)
   - Refund processing
   - Payout initiation
   - Status updates

## Rollback Procedure

If any step fails critically:

1. **Clean payment data:**

   ```sql
   -- Clear payments table
   DELETE FROM payments;
   ```

2. **Reset temp files:**

   ```bash
   rm -f scripts/migration/temp/payments-extracted.json
   rm -f scripts/migration/temp/payment-extraction-stats.json
   rm -f scripts/migration/temp/payments-created.json
   rm -f scripts/migration/temp/payment-creation-stats.json
   rm -f scripts/migration/temp/payment-validation-report.json
   rm -f scripts/migration/temp/phase-5-completed.json
   ```

3. **Fix identified issues**

4. **Re-run from Step 1**

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas

1. **Booking ID Mapping**

   - Risk: Payment references non-existent booking
   - Mitigation: Validate all bookings exist before creating payments
   - Impact: Payment without booking breaks business logic

2. **Stripe Reference Integrity**

   - Risk: Loss of payment_intent_id breaks Stripe integration
   - Mitigation: Validate all Stripe IDs format and preserve exactly
   - Impact: Cannot process refunds or track payments in Stripe

3. **Financial Calculations**

   - Risk: Incorrect amount calculations affect revenue
   - Mitigation: Validate sum of stylist_payout + platform_fee = final_amount
   - Impact: Financial reporting errors, payout discrepancies

4. **Status Mapping**

   - Risk: Incorrect status prevents payment processing
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive status mapping with validation
   - Impact: Payments stuck in wrong state, cannot capture or refund

5. **Duplicate Payments**
   - Risk: Multiple payments for single booking
   - Mitigation: Unique constraint on booking_id
   - Impact: Overcharging customers, financial discrepancies

### Data Quality Checks

1. **Before Migration:**

   - Verify all referenced bookings exist in Phase 4 output
   - Check for reasonable amount ranges (no extreme values)
   - Validate Stripe ID formats

2. **During Migration:**

   - Monitor error rates per step
   - Log all skipped payments with reasons
   - Validate foreign key relationships before insertion

3. **After Migration:**
   - Run comprehensive validation queries
   - Compare financial totals with MySQL
   - Test sample transactions in application

---

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Processing

- Process payments in batches of 500-1000 for production
- Monitor memory usage during large payment migrations
- Consider using database transactions for atomicity

### Index Creation

After migration, ensure these indexes exist:

```sql
-- Payment lookup optimization
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_booking_id
ON payments(booking_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_payment_intent_id
ON payments(payment_intent_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_status
ON payments(status);

-- Financial reporting optimization
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_created_at
ON payments(created_at);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_status_created
ON payments(status, created_at);

-- Payout tracking
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_stylist_transfer
ON payments(stylist_transfer_id)
WHERE stylist_transfer_id IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Migration Progress:**

   - Records processed per minute
   - Success/error rates per step
   - Memory usage during processing

2. **Data Quality:**

   - Percentage of payments with valid bookings
   - Percentage of payments with Stripe IDs
   - Status transformation success rate

3. **Financial Impact:**
   - Total amount migrated
   - Platform fees preserved
   - Refund amounts tracked
   - Average payment amounts

### Alerting Thresholds

- Error rate > 5% â Stop migration and investigate
- Financial discrepancy > 1000 NOK â Review calculations
- Missing Stripe IDs > 1% â Check data extraction
- Orphaned payments > 0 â Review booking relationships

---

## Post-Migration Verification

### Business Validation

1. **Financial Reconciliation:**

   ```sql
   -- Compare totals with accounting records
   SELECT
     DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
     COUNT(*) as payment_count,
     SUM(final_amount) as total_revenue,
     SUM(platform_fee) as total_fees,
     SUM(stylist_payout) as total_payouts,
     SUM(refunded_amount) as total_refunds
   FROM payments
   WHERE status = 'succeeded'
   GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)
   ORDER BY month DESC;
   ```

2. **Stripe Consistency:**

   - Export payment IDs and verify against Stripe dashboard
   - Check transfer IDs match Stripe Connect transfers
   - Validate application fee amounts

3. **Booking-Payment Integrity:**

   ```sql
   -- Ensure all completed bookings have payments
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM bookings b
   LEFT JOIN payments p ON b.id = p.booking_id
   WHERE b.status = 'completed' AND p.id IS NULL;  -- Should be minimal
   ```

### Next Steps

After successful Phase 5 completion:

1. **Enable Payment Processing:**

   - Configure Stripe webhooks for new system
   - Test payment capture workflow
   - Verify refund processing

2. **Financial Reporting:**

   - Set up revenue dashboards
   - Configure payout reports
   - Implement financial analytics

3. **Proceed to Next Phase:**
   - Phase 6: Chat/Messaging Migration (if applicable)
   - Or begin post-migration optimization

This comprehensive test plan ensures the Phase 5 Payments Migration maintains financial integrity while successfully transforming the MySQL payment system into the new PostgreSQL structure with enhanced tracking and reporting capabilities.
